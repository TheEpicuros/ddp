# TogetherOS — A new operating system for humanity

**OS = Operating System (not “open source”).** TogetherOS is a cooperation-first stack that helps people self-organize: direct legislation, mutual aid, a fair social economy, and shared knowledge — all woven into practical tools and clear discipline for contributors.

**Canonical categories & keyword palette:** see [`docs/DDP_CATEGORIES_AND_KEYWORDS.md`](docs/DDP_CATEGORIES_AND_KEYWORDS.md).

## The 8 core categories
- Governance & Direct Legislation
- Community & Mutual Aid
- Social Economy & Co-ops
- Education & Knowledge Commons
- Health & Wellbeing
- Environment & Regeneration
- Housing & Infrastructure
