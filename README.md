# TogetherOS — A new operating system for humanity

**OS = Operating System (not “open source”).** TogetherOS is a cooperation-first stack that helps people self-organize: direct legislation, mutual aid, a fair social economy, and shared knowledge — all woven into practical tools and clear discipline for contributors.

**Canonical categories & keyword palette:** see [`docs/DDP_CATEGORIES_AND_KEYWORDS.md`](docs/DDP_CATEGORIES_AND_KEYWORDS.md).
📜 **Manifesto**: See the canonical vision for TogetherOS in [docs/Manifesto.md](docs/Manifesto.md).

## The 8 Cooperation Paths (canonical)

1. **Collaborative Education** — learn, co-teach, certify, and document shared knowledge so communities can build faster together.
2. **Social Economy** — mutual aid, time-banking, micro-funds, and **Social Horizon** crypto to finance the commons.
3. **Common Wellbeing** — health, nutrition, movement, and care networks that reduce isolation and improve daily life.
4. **Cooperative Technology** — open, privacy-respecting tools and infrastructure that communities own and operate.
5. **Collective Governance** — open deliberation, direct legislation, and empathy-first moderation for real democratic power-sharing.
6. **Community Connection** — local groups, events, co-ops, and city-level collaboration mapped to real people and places.
7. **Collaborative Media & Culture** — stories, film, music, writing, and archives that celebrate cooperation and courage.
8. **Common Planet** — habitat repair, food forests, circular materials, and climate-positive logistics.
