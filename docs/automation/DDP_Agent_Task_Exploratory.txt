Title: Agent Task Lane — Exploratory Phase
Version: 2025-09-26

Purpose
- Stand up an “Agent lane” to run tiny, verified repository changes with strict proofs.
- Keep scope safe via per-issue allowlists and required checks.

Lane Rules
1) Two lanes active: (A) Codex gateway (codex/* only), (B) Agent lane (scoped paths via issue allowlist).
2) One change → one verification: each Agent PR must print minimal proof-lines and touch ONLY the allowlisted paths.
3) Docs-first: any change to workflows, issue templates, or discipline must update knowledge docs in the same PR or the immediate next one.

Required Status Check
- Name: agent-pr-checks
- Blocking on main via Branch Protection.

Agent PR Proof-lines (in Checks)
- PROOF: ACTIONLINT=OK
- PROOF: YAMLLINT=OK
- PROOF: SMOKE=OK
- PROOF: AGENT_PR_CHECKS=OK

Allowlist & Scope
- Each issue defines a path allowlist. Reviewer must verify changed files ⊆ allowlist before merge.

Failure Classification (quick)
- 401/403/404/422 per our discipline taxonomy.
- Syntax (YAML/JSON/PS) → fix and re-run until proofs print.

Promotion to Standard
- After 2–3 successful tasks: remove “Exploratory” from titles; fold this lane into OPERATIONS.
- Changelog flag: AGENT_LANE=STANDARD
