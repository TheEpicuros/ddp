# TogetherOS â€” Overview

**TogetherOS** is an operating system for human cooperation: a stack of social, economic, and governance tools that communities can actually run. It helps groups of people leverage the great power of an aligned collective, solve common problems and prosper. Groups share knowledge and power, fund the commons, and make decisions together â€” with empathy-first moderation and tiny, verifiable steps.

## What weâ€™re asking contributors to do
1. **Read the Manifesto** to align on goals and scope.  
2. **Introduce yourself in Discussions #88**: share your skills, tools, and the Path youâ€™re drawn to.  
3. **In #88, say which Path/module you want to help with** and propose a tiny first change; weâ€™ll assign or open the issue and point you to a starter task 
4. **Reflect in #88 after merge**: what you learned, what to try next. We grow by iteration.

## Core Mechanics
- **Support Points**: measurable signals for proposals, teams, and projects; used to route attention and resources.
- **Empathy-first moderation**: de-escalation and restorative patterns to keep discourse generative.
- **Tiny, Verifiable Steps**: every change ships as the smallest unit with proofs (lint/smoke/validators) before scaling.
- **Archetype-guided onboarding**: paths that match contributor styles (builder, organizer, researcher, storyteller, etc.).

## Initial Delivery Tracks
- **Community Connection** â€” local groups, events, and a geo-map of cooperation projects.
- **Social Economy (incl. Social Horizon)** â€” time-banking, mutual-aid flows, micro-funds, and a crypto rail that serves the commons.
- **Collective Governance** â€” open deliberation, direct legislation modules, and participation metrics.
- **Cooperative Technology** â€” privacy-respecting infra and contributor tooling.

## Contribution Discipline
- **Docs-first**: every change updates the relevant docs and playbooks.
- **Least-privilege + proofs**: branches must pass `ci/lint` and `ci/smoke` before merge.
- **One smallest change â†’ verify â†’ proceed**: reduce risk, maintain momentum.
