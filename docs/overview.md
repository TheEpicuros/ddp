# DDP Overview

## About This Project
The **Direct Democracy Platform (DDP)** is an open-source effort to build infrastructure for **social change**.  
It combines community, cooperative economy, and collective governance with open, decentralized technology.

## Four Tracks
- **Technology** — Open sourced, decentralized code, automation, infrastructure, and tools.  
- **Community** — Belonging, connection, healing, participation. We take care of our basic needs together.  
- **Social Economy** — Thriving through co-ops, collective purchasing, timebanks, mutual aid, microloans, mutual funding and investment, 501(c), housing trusts, a just health system, and our own Social Horizon crypto.  
- **Governance** — Leaderless, directly democratic, AI assisted, empathy based, transparent collective decision-making. No ideologies, no parties, no professional leaders, no pyramids of power.  

## Why It Matters
- Locally: support each other through mutual aid, timebanks, co-ops, events, and belonging.  
- Nationally: build cooperative legal and financial structures, housing, healthcare, and education systems.  
- Globally: share best practices, coordinate cooperation, and create a cooperative economy with fair wealth distribution.
